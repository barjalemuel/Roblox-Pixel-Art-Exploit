# Roblox-Pixel-Art-Exploit

Description: This exploit for Roblox consists an external application used to obtain pixel data, and a second script used to apply that data directly inside of Roblox.

Important: The pixel data retrieved by the executable file copies the data to your clipboard. 
This is how the data manually transfers from program to exploit script; you paste
the data that's copied to your clipboard into the variable at the top of the lua script, in between two single quotes.

I would use a Roblox GUI to input the data, instead of pasting it directly into the script, but the Roblox TextBox has
a character limit. Because of this, you have to execute the script each time you want to load the pixel data into the game.
