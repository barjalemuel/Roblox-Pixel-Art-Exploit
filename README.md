# Roblox-Pixel-Art-Exploit

Description: This exploit for Roblox consists an external application used to obtain pixel data, and a second script used to apply that data directly inside of Roblox.

Instructions:

Step 1)
Open JSONPixelData.exe.

Step 2)
Select desired image.

Step 3)
Select corresponding canvas size (matching the canvas size you have in-game)

Step 4)
Click the 'Get Data' button
(The pixel data is now copied to your clipboard)

Step 5)
Open your Roblox script utility with PixelArtExploit.lua

Step 6)
Paste JSON data into the 'json' variable on line #1, between two single quotes.

Step 7)
Configure the boolean 'public' variable on line #2, depending if you want to display on a public or private board.
(You must be at the public board for the remotes to work)

Step 8)
Closet hack and get kids to look at your 'drawings' so you can feel successful for once in your life.



Reminder: The pixel data retrieved by the executable file copies the data to your clipboard. 
This is how the data manually transfers from program to exploit script; you paste
the data that's copied to your clipboard into the variable at the top of the lua script, in between two single quotes.

Note: I would use a Roblox GUI to input the data instead of pasting it directly into the script, but the Roblox TextBox has
a character limit. Because of this, you have to execute the script each time you want to load the pixel data into the game.
